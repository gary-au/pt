Description: The pt package implements (cumulative) prospect theory and
    other theories of decision making under risk. A practically unlimited
    number of choices can be specified. The package allows for different
    probability weighting functions and utility functions to be specified, as
    well as their parameters. Other features include the ability to plot both
    individual and families of probability weighting curves and individual
    utility function curves. Single-stage decision tree graphics are also
    provided, along with the ability to draw the probability simplex and
    indifference curves. Certainty equivalents and risk premiums can be
    plotted. Theoretical predictions for different risky decision making
    theories can be compared against each other and empirical data.
