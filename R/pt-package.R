#' @title pt: An R package for Prospect Theory
#' @description A package for comparing prospect theory to other risky decision making theories.
#' @details
#' The pt package provides the ability to create, save and visualise choices.
#' The results for different risky decision making theories can be calculated
#' for these choice situations. 
#'
#' The fastest way to get started is to either create choices from the command line
#' using the create_choices function or load in choices from previously prepared
#' external text files using the create_choices_from_file function.
#'
#' Once the choices are in R, it is possible to visualise them using drawChoices.
#' Newly created choices can be saved to text files using save_choices.
#' 
#' The predictions of various risky decision making theories can then be run on
#' choices using the following functions:
#'
#' compareEV (for expected value)
#'
#' compareEU (expected utility)
#'
#' compareRDU (rank-dependent utility)
#'
#' comparePT (prospect theory)
#'
#' compareSWU (subjectively weighted utility)
#'
#' compareSWAU (subjectively weighted average utility)
#'
#' compareRAM (rank-affected multiplicative weights utility)
#'
#' compareTAX ((special) transfer of attention exchange utility)
#'
#' compareGDU ((lower) gains decomposition utility)
#'
#' comparePRT (prospective reference theory utility)
#'
#'
#' Visualisation functions include:
#' 
#' drawSimplex (draws the Marschak-Machina unit probability simplex)
#'
#' plot_pwf (draws a single probability weighting function)
#'
#' plot_pwf_family (draws families of probability weighting functions)
#'
#' plot_risk_premium (draws the risk premium)
#'
#' plot_utility_function (draws the utility function)
